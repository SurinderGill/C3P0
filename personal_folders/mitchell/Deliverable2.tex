\subsection{System Architecture}
\label{sub:system_architecture}
% Begin SubSection


The main purpose of our application is to allow users to identify a beer by its specific characteristics. The task is performed
by providing information about the beer to different experts from a central module. Therefore, it lends itself to have an overall
architecture that is data centered.\\


The application will take the information received from the user and pass it to the central data center. The data center will 
then request information from the applicable experts. Due to the direction of the requests, the architecture will more specifically 
be a blackboard architecture.\\


The choice to use blackboard architecture is because of the benefits it offers with scalability and concurrency. More experts can
be added to the application as it progresses without any significant changes in the structure of the application. It also 
allows the system to function quickly due its concurrent processes. Each expert that is consulted can perform its request at the
same time.

% Begin SubSection
\subsubsection{Client/User}

The person who will be interacting with the application. Performs actions on the interface. 

\subsubsection{Interface} 

The point of interaction between the user and the controller. It offers the user the ability to perform
searches for beers and other actions. It sends and receives data from the controller.

\subsubsection{Controller} 

The controller receives the information from the interface. It uses the information to perform actions on the database and the
experts. It will then provide data to the interface.

\subsubsection{Experts}

Experts process information and requests sent to them by the controller and pass information back.

\subsubsection{Database}

The database stores all of the information on the beers to be searched through. It will receive requests from the controller
and respond with the applicable data.

\section*{IMPORTANT NOTES}
\begin{itemize}
%	\item You do \underline{NOT} need to provide a text explanation of each diagram; the diagram should speak for itself
	\item Please document any non-standard notations that you may have used
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Rule of Thumb}: if you feel there is any doubt surrounding the meaning of your notations, document them
	\end{itemize}
	\item Some diagrams may be difficult to fit into one page
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It is OK if the text is small but please ensure that it is readable when printed
		\item If you need to break a diagram onto multiple pages, please adopt a system of doing so and thoroughly explain how it can be reconnected from one page to the next; if you are unsure about this, please ask about it
	\end{itemize}
	\item Please submit the latest version of Deliverable 1 with Deliverable 2
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It does not have to be a freshly printed version; the latest marked version is OK
	\end{itemize}
	\item If you do \underline{NOT} have a Division of Labour sheet, your deliverable will \underline{NOT} be marked
\end{itemize}
